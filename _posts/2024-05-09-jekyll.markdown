The Hexo tool I used to generate the website produced numerous errors, seemingly due to dependency issues arising over time. I decided to switch to Jekyll since GitHub Pages offers built-in support for it. However, after setting up the site locally, I discovered that Jekyll isn't immune to dependency problems either. The theme I selected required a version of Jekyll incompatible with the GitHub Pages Jekyll plugin.

In the end, I generated the site with Jekyll using two repositories, as I did before. Perhaps I could have salvaged the Hexo version in less time. Oh well.
