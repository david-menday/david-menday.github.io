I took a break from Elder Scrolls Online a few years after participating in the beta. However, about two years ago, I decided to dive back in with a new expansion. Unfortunately, the Swedish guild I had played with previously had disbanded, and we played on the North American servers.

When I returned to the game, I was quickly recruited by a predominantly American guild. One of the things this guild does is teach people how to do Veteran Trials, a significant step up in difficulty compared to the rest of the game, which is relatively easy. I wish the game had multiple difficulty levels like Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard, with better loot rewards for higher challenges. For now, I'll settle for veteran dungeons and trials, which offer exclusive sets and improved PvE gear through veteran and hard modes.
