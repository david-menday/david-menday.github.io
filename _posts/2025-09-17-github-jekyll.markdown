Yup I haven't touched this site in a while. Still playing Elder Scrolls Online...
I am experimenting a bit with how I add posts here.

Technical details:
I have been using two repos to generate the static web pages for www.menday.se.
I was locally running bundle installed jekyll to generated the static web pages,
which then were copied to the actual git repo.
Now I am skipping that extra step and only use one repo.
