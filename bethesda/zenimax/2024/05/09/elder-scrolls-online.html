  <p>I took a break from Elder Scrolls Online a few years after participating in the beta. However, about two years ago, I decided to dive back in with a new expansion. Unfortunately, the Swedish guild I had played with previously had disbanded, and we played on the North American servers.</p>

<p><img src="/images/elder-scrolls-online.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;" /></p>

<p>When I returned to the game, I was quickly recruited by a predominantly American guild. One of the things this guild does is teach people how to do Veteran Trials, a significant step up in difficulty compared to the rest of the game, which is relatively easy. I wish the game had multiple difficulty levels like Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard, with better loot rewards for higher challenges. For now, Iâ€™ll settle for veteran dungeons and trials, which offer exclusive sets and improved PvE gear through veteran and hard modes.</p>
